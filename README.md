# Count Repetitive

**For my project I need to develop an algorithm that counts and tracks repetitive data. I opened this repository to write this algorithm.**

## Requirements

    QT (version 5.15.2 and higher)

- This system shows random numbers between 1 and 20 in a window.

- These numbers continuously flow from top to bottom in the scrollview.

- With the start and stop buttons, we start and stop the flow of this data.

- The data flow happens in 0.5 seconds, so each new data comes every 0.5 seconds.
